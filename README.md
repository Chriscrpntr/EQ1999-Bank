# EQ1999-Bank

Start by logging into eq p1999 and use the /outputfile inventory command

After that run the program
Select the database tab.
Click add character which will open a file selector box there will be a <charactername>-Inventory.txt file in your EverQuest folder to select.
Select the .txt file for the character. 
Below will be a list of all the characters you've added.
You will need to update the database via the  "Create Fresh Database From Character List" button each time you add a new character or make a new /outputfile inventory file, however the path will remain the same so you do not need to add a character repeatedly only the first time. The /output file inventory command replaces the old file with the same name.

The "Delete Selected Character" button removes the characters from being updated into the search window.

Then you can go to the "Search" tab, each search bar is optional if left blank will search all characters and all items.
