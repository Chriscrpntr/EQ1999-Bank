# EQ1999-Bank

Start by logging into eq p1999 and use the /outputfile inventory command

After that run the program
Select the database tab and enter in the name/alias of the character you're adding.
Click add character which will open a file selector box there will be a <charactername>-Inventory.txt file in your EverQuest folder to select.
Select the .txt file for the character. 
Below will be a list of all the characters you've added.
You will need to update the database via the  "Create Fresh Database From Character List" button each time you add a new character or make a new /outputfile inventory file, however the path will remain the same so you do not need to add a character repeatedly only the first time. The /output file inventory command replaces the old file with the same name.

The "Reset Character Data" button clears the list and starts you over in case you misnamed a character.

Then you can go to the "Search" tab to search for an item name and it will filter all the characters with that item and which bag slot it's in.
